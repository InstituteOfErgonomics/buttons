The application stopped the time when a test subject released a button on the steering wheel (which was continiously hold) until the test subject touched the display of an Android smartphone.
The coordinates and times were recorded and send to a driving simulation (SILAB, WIVW GmbH). 
The application also send triggers to an eye tracking system (Dikablis 2, Ergoneers GmbH) when the steering wheel button was released and when the display was touched.
For the steering wheel button, the method from the Mobile Detection Task application was used (microphone channel via ear phone jack)
